## React Geolocation

This project uses a hitbox centered around a set location. 

The goal is that if the user is not within a close range of the location, the application should say "Not Close." If the user is close or at the location, it should state "You are Here!" 

The user's position should update automatically as they move around; they may also choose a different location to test (not implemented yet).
